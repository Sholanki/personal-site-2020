Derek is a proud husband, father and mobile web enthusiast. For as long as he can remember, Derek always practiced art and design through various mediums, but he attributes the CSS Zen Garden [2005] for steering his passion towards the web.

Today, Derek has sights set on thinking about design systems, resiliant components and building strong front-end foundations that help support fast, accessible and inclusive web interfaces.

When Derek isnâ€™t designing things at Cloud Four he enjoys spending time in nature and photographing his family and other subjects of interest around the Pacific Northwest.
