Derek is a proud husband, father and mobile web enthusiast. As our senior front-end designer, Derek often works at the intersection of design and development. For as long as he can remember, Derek always practiced art and design through various mediums, but he attributes the CSS Zen Garden [2005] for steering his passion towards the web.

Today, Derek applies his skills sketching, prototyping and refactoring CSS with his sights set on building strong front-end foundations that help support fast, accessible and inclusive web interfaces. His favorite developer topic to discuss over drinks are git commands and his favorite place to have a conversation is on a chairlift.

When Derek isnâ€™t designing things at Cloud Four he enjoys spending time researching nutrition, natural medicine and photographing his family and other subjects of interest around the Pacific Northwest.
