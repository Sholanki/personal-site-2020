I set out to launch a side-project in under 24-hours. I wanted to choose something obtainable. Something where I could start small and grow as what I built attracted new users. The end result is the MergeLinks Newsletter, a weekly email of curated links to articles, resources, freebies and inspiration for web designers and developers. Here’s a quick overview of the time I spent launching my side project.

## A little backstory
One of my goals this year was to start an email newsletter. I have read a few great stories and experiences of others experimenting with a 24-hour challenge format, most notably Nathan Barry and I thought I would try to apply this technique to this project. I didn’t document the progress as well as Nathan did, but I hope that this blog posts gives some insight into my process.

Honestly, I was less interested in the idea of ‘launching something in 24-hours’ and more concerned with just executing and seeing my simple idea through to launch. I’m keen on the idea of executing and shipping but I have let too many personal projects lay dormant. So I sat down with a fresh cup of coffee and started to refine my goal and define some parameters which would help me define if my efforts were a success or failure. Here’s what I came up with.

## My goal:
My Goals was to create a email newsletter that I would want to subscribe to – Something that I would look forward to receiving once a week. It was important to me that it looked great on any device but I didn’t want to burn a lot of time coding a responsive email template up front. I knew I could always come back and do that later. I was concerned with aesthetics but I also wanted to make sure that design didn’t get in the way of shipping.

## My Steps
Here is what I decided I should focus my energy on next:

– Choose an audience and a content type
– Choose an email marketing platform
– Choose a name
– Write a short description
– Purchase a domain
– Create a logo
– Design and launch a landing page
– Define my process for curating and organizing content
– Beg and plead for some early subscribers
– Send out the first newsletter

## Taking Action
I began jotting down ideas and answers to my questions and quickly determined that I would be launching a weekly email targeted towards web designers and developers that contained a curated list of timely links to thought-provoking articles, resources, tutorials, and inspiration. This was in fact something that I would like to receive and I felt like email was the right tool for delivering this content. I also felt like this would benefit me, because I don’t have a really good system for cataloging important resources online. MergeLinks was also scratching my own itch as it allowed for easy browsing of my each weekly email I sent.

## Choosing the tools
I had chosen my audience and my content, now I needed to research and choose an email marketing platform. I looked at CampaignMonitor, Awebber, Emma and MailChimp. I wanted a free solution that I could set-up and customize quickly. I needed to be able to send responsive or mobile friendly emails without too much extra leg-work. Plus a good user-interface design and user-experience was a must.

I ended up going with MailChimp because their free plan was more then I needed to get started, the interface was excellent and the reporting looked to be sufficient. After looking through their pre-made templates I decided that they all imposed ‘too much design‘ for what I was looking for so I ran a few tests with their drag-and-drop visual editor. The MailChimp visual editor is really easy to get the hang of and you can start by selecting one of several pre-build boilerplate layouts. I did run into a few quirks with the interface and I think MailChimp has some opportunities to further improving the tools and the experience. That might be an interesting follow-up post in the future. But don’t let that comment leave a sour taste in your mouth. That team did an amazing job on their product and I choose it because I felt it was the best.

## Choosing a name
I have started plenty-a-side-project only to get hung up on choosing a name. This was not going to be the case this time. However after some brainstorming and domain searching nothing was quite clicking. I struggled with it for a bit but soon realized I was peeking into a rabbit-hole and needed to come to a quicker decision on the name. I looked back at my domain registrar and saw another domain I had already registered. mergethemes.com is a domain I registered with the intent of starting a small WordPress theme shop. I do still plan to pursue that goal, and I thought maybe this newsletter could be the precursor to MergeThemes. So thus, I had a name, MergeLinks. The domain was available, so I swooped it up and began setting up my hosting account with WP Engine.

## Refining my Elevator Pitch
I wanted to write a brief description of what the email was all about so potential subscribers knew exactly what they were signing up to receive. I wanted to say who it was for, what it would contain, and how often they would receive it. Pretty simple right? This what I came up with:

## Designing the logo
It was time to move onto to organizing some pixels. The first thing I wanted to tackle was the logo. In the back of my mind, I new I could create an amazing logo but I also knew that it was more important to have a logo, then to have an un-finished soon-to-me masterpiece. So I set out to create something simple. After a few simple pencil sketches I arrived at a simple icon featuring a rounded m and the word mark for MergeLinks. It was important to me that there was a good balance of stroke weight between the icon and the typeface. The logo needed to be able to stand on its own for favicon and social media profiles. I wanted to it be soft and approachable, but still give off a modern and techy vibe.

## Designing and Developing the Landing Page
Now it was on to one of my favorite parts of the project, the design and development. I sat down as I always do and started sketching out my basic needs for a landing page. They contained, the logo, a short description, an email input and some links to some social media sites, either to share or follow. Again, not too complicated. I tested a few different colors and ended up with a blue because I felt it was both inviting yet familiar in the web industry visual setting. I decided on a full screen approach and began mocking up the components in Photoshop.

My goal was to design and develop the landing page with a mobile first strategy. Again, easy to do for a one-page site. Plus I feel like that’s a great way to go about making things online. I started my mock-ups with a centered layout for mobile, but I knew that I wanted tablet landscape views, laptops and larger screens to get a left justified version. For the responsive grid I choose the opportunity to get a little bit more familiar with Bourbon Neat. So far I really like Bourbon and Neat. This was the second time I played around with the tools and things went really quickly. I added a bit of animated polish to the loading sequence and bam, the site was ready to launch.

## Content is King
Its true what they say, content is king… or queen. Either way it’s important and I knew that I had to put some time and energy into thinking about how I was going to approach organizing and curating the content for the newsletter each week. Something I have been trying to engrain into my writing process to is to start each post with an outline and goal for what I want to convey with the post. So I set out to do something similar for MergeLinks. I created a list of general topics I would be interested in receiving in an email. I decided on articles, resources, freebies and inspiration. I wanted it to be weighted in favor of articles, resources and inspiration and focus less on freebies since there are so many resources out there for that already.

I set out to catalog and and index some interesting stuff online. I already had a smattering of links and bookmarks, stored in various different places ranging from sticky notes to to-to lists to basecamp comments. So I set aside some time and started moving everything over to Instapaper. I like instapaper and I was already using it to catalog interesting articles I found online. I already had the Instapaper bookmarklet running in my browser and on my phone so it required very little effort to start using it. So, I created a new folder and got to clicking and organizing. As I worked towards gathering enough content for my first issue, I started looking at the links of context to the other links in the email. I wanted to appeal to a fairly broad audience but I didn’t want to be too general. I also didn’t want to be group too many similiar links. For example, even though I love using sass as my pre-processor and I would find links to sass resources helpful, I didn’t want to include too many in the same email.

Next, I grouped my links, created my thumbnail images and started populating the email in Mailchimp. I was on my way to launching my side project within 24 hours and I was feeling good. I knew there was stuff I was leaving out and things I could have done better. I could have designed a better logo, or I could have spent some more time creating social media accounts and refining the seo for the landing page. But that was OK. I didn’t identify those things as being critical to launching and I knew I would eventually get around to doing those things.

Beg and plead for some early subscribers
It was time to reach out to my friends, colleges fellow inbox acquaintances and self-plug my new project. Initially I was a little hesitant about this because I didn’t want to come off as too skeezy pushing yet another email or service that someone should sign up for. However, I found that it came pretty naturally because I was passionate about what I was doing and I genuinely felt that what I had produced was good and the people I was reaching out to were likely to appreciate it as well. The response was terrific and I was able to add a few quality subscribers list.

## Hitting the Launch Button
I was eager to launch. Everything was ready to go. I had done it. Yes it was a simple thing to do, but something I am proud of and am looking forward to growing.
