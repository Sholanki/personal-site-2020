I didn't grow up playing video games but I might grow old playing them now.

- Growing up. My parents were very adamant about not allowing game consoles in our home. Instead, they heavily promoted playing outside, and for that I'm still thankful to this day.
- A few neighbors had game consoles that I would play very occasionally play. Some games that I can recall playing very briefly:
- Pitfall on Atari, Super Mario Brother's 3, Duck Hunt, Sonic the Hedgehog. Oh and I have a fond memory of pumping a few stacks of quarters into a Golden Axe arcade console one summer at a restaurant my Family used to frequent back in Ohio.
- My experience playing games at my friends houses involved me watching them play their turns, for what felt like an eternity â€” because they were really good. And then when my turn finally came along I usually only lasted a few short moments before falling in a pit, running into a goomba or the like and then it was time to pass the controller and endure the long wait until it was my turn again.

In 2019 I got the bug to decided to purchase a game console. I decided on a Nintendo Switch.

Here are the games I've played and found really enjoyable on the Switch:

- Zelda: Breath of the Wild. (wow)
- Super Mario Odyssey
- Splatoon 2 (My Guilty Pleasure)
- Hollow Knight
- Guacamelee Super Turbo Championship Edition
- Mario + Rabbids Kingdom Battle

Well, perhaps my Nintendo Switch was a gateway console, because my truly amazing wife bought me a PlayStation 4 Pro for my most recent birthday. Here are the games I have been playing on my PS4 Pro

- Marvel's Spider-man
- Horizon Zero Dawn
- Ollie Ollie 2 Welcome to Olliewood
