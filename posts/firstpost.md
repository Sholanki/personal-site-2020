Few days of your life will be as memorable as the day you get married. The love, the nerves, the family, the words, the laughing, the hugging, the crying â€“ will all be engrained in my memory forever. Jenny and I set out to try to capture the emotion and the details of the day in a few different videos. We worked with friend and colleague Benjamin Vanderveen to create this video.
