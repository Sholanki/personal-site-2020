I'd like to share some browser features that everyone, not only designers and developers can embrace to make surfing the web more productive. While some of these things may seem scary at first to someone who has never tried them I've tried to identify things with a low technical barrier or things that only require simple keyboard shortcuts.

## Find in page

This is something I do littery dozens of times each day while trying to quickly locate information on a webpage. `shift` + `cmd` + `F` will open up a find in page interface in just about any desktop browser that I can think of.

- Chrome's mobile browser has [this feature](https://android.stackexchange.com/questions/84352/how-to-find-in-page-in-google-chrome-mobile)
- iOS Safari includes this feature inside the actions menu. [See how](https://www.lifewire.com/search-for-text-in-safari-on-iphone-2000562)
- Here's a [link](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/search-contents-current-page-text-or-links?redirectlocale=en-US&redirectslug=Searching+within+a+page) how to do this in Firefox mobile.
